## Subject Area Description
The ENCOUNTER table contains one record for each significant medical-related interaction between a patient and a medical provider regardless of care setting or type of encounter. All known encounters should be included whether known through claims, through clinical systems, or a third source type. Inclusion, exclusions, classification, and uniqueness of an encounter is dependent on the type of service and care setting. For a precise description, please refer to the Utilization Implementation Guidelines and the Virtual Visits Proposal and Guidelines on the private HCSRN website.

## Comments

### Defining *Encounters*
In general, the intention of the encounter file is to describe all significant interactions between patients and medical providers. It should include such things as inpatient stays, emergency department visits,  other outpatient hospital services (e.g. same day surgeries), ambulatory visits, home health encounters, and non-hospital residential stays including skilled nursing facility, rehab, nursing home, overnight hospice facility, and overnight dialysis facility.


### What types of encounters should be included?
See the definition of the variables EncType and Encounter_Subtype for the full list of the types of encounters that should be included (subject of course to local data availability).  Questions about whether a particular type of encounter should be included and how it should be characterized should be directed to the VDW Utilization Workgroup.

All available encounters should be included, even those taking place at external providers (in other words, claims data should be included if that is the only source you have for a given encounter).  Sites with known ""data blind spots"" (e.g., hospice care is subcontracted out on a capitated basis, and no claims are submitted) should document them on their Utilization implementation page on the HCSRN Portal.

Similarly, data on all services provided by the health plan, whether or not they were provided to a member (enrollee) of the plan should be included.  (This means that this file will frequently need to be checked against Enrollment in order to identify study populations-users should not assume that people found in the Utilization tables are members of the health plan, or that anything in particular is known about them.)

### Uniquely Identifying an Encounter
A single inpatient stay, non-acute institutional stay (such as SNF, Rehab, Nursing Home, overnight Hospice or Dialysis stay) or emergency visit has 1 record in the encounter file.  For ambulatory visit, virtual care, telephone, e-mail, lab only, radiology only and “other” encounters, a unique encounter record is defined as each patient and provider medical contact documented in the source data (exclude scheduling appointments and other administrative tasks).

A unique combination of the following variables is an encounter:  MRN, adate, enctype, encounter_subtype, provider, facility_code, and appointment time (if available).

### Classification/Inclusion/Exclusion rules
The encounter file only contains data where a medical provider interacts with a patient.  Medical providers include: physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, lab technicians, social workers, etc.—generally, people licensed to provide medical care and closely related services.

Ambulatory Visits (a subset of the encounter file) are limited to outpatient encounters where the provider is licensed to prescribe medical services.  However, if the source data contain separate records with a lab or radiology tech, then code these encounters as “Lab Only” or “Radiology Only” encounter types respectively.

Recurring visits to the same clinicians on the same day should be maintained as separate encounters if possible.

Include denied claims if the actual utilization occurred.  Exclude claims where the utilization didn’t take place or for claims that have been identified as false.
Classify “Vaccine Only” encounters as “Other Encounter”.

Telephone calls should be included only if the call was between the patient and a provider for medical services or advice.  Hence a call to schedule or cancel an appointment should be excluded.

Visits to the pharmacy to pick-up medications are not encounters and therefore are excluded.

Classify same day inpatient discharges as inpatient if the patient is admitted to the hospital for an inpatient stay.

### Rules about transfers within hospitals:
Treat as 1 stay in the encounter file if a patient is transferred from one acute inpatient station to another acute inpatient station within the same hospital.  Treat as separate encounters if a patient is transferred from an acute inpatient station to a long term care station (such as SNF, Rehab or other non-acute inpatient care).

The PROVIDER variable is most useful for outpatient encounters. Inpatient stays should have a single PROVIDER for the entire stay, even if multiple providers performed procedures during the stay.  If possible, use the admitting physician as the provider for all care during the stay.  (Note that the Procedure and Diagnosis files have fields to signify the provider that actually performed a given procedure/made a given diagnosis where that is known.)

For claims-sourced encounters where there is a first and last service date, but the particular dates of the individual services included are not known (e.g., claims for dialysis) use first service date for ADate and last service date for DDate.

Roll-up the professional and inpatient rounding services (outpatient providers who visit their patients in the hospital) into inpatient stays.  Store the details of these services in the procedure and diagnosis files.

Classify admissions to residential alcohol and chemical dependency programs as “Rehab”.

The index variable ENC_ID uniquely identifies each encounter and is used to link the ENCOUNTER file to the both the DIAGNOSIS and PROCEDURE files.  Multiple encounters to the same provider on the same day are allowed if that is the truth in the source data and have unique ENC_ID values.

All variables are required to simplify programming.  Set to missing or unknown if the variable is unavailable at your site.   Consider using the SAS compress option to reduce the size of the file and improve I/O processing.

Use local HEDIS definitions as guidelines to classify encounters into encounter type and subtype values at your site, or refer to guidelines provided on the HCSRN portal.

In addition, the utilization work group is developing universal guidelines for classification rules from claims and Clarity/EPIC data sources.

### Special rules for counting emergency encounters

The definition of an inpatient stay established for measuring hospital activities across the country sets the requirement for starting an admission with time of arrival at the emergency department.  It is the standard for assuring consistent counts of emergency encounters and hospital stays in national health statistics.  Since some emergency encounters result in an inpatient stay while others don’t,  identify emergency encounters at all sites by selecting enctype='ED' or (enctype='IP' and admitting_source='ED').  Some sites will have both the ED and Inpatient record.  Remove duplicates (MRN, adate, facility_code) to avoid double-counting.

Users of this data are scientists/researchers across many disciplines, who have very divergent concepts, theories, variables, methods, and analytic paradigms.  Hence, the VDW utilization files should be rich and complex, just as medical care is rich and complex.  We are asking sites to match the source outpatient data systems when the source data matches the spec. Each project should decide how to handle the differential ascertainment of encounters across the sites participating in the specific study, not the VDW programmers.
