# ENROLLMENT
Version = 5.0.0  Date = 11/16/2021 StdVar = &\_vdw\_enroll

## Subject Area Description
The ENROLLMENT table contains periods of time during which we believe to have at least the partial capture of medical care information either because of enrollment in a health insurance plan that we know about or as a patient of a care delivery system that we own or interact with. Insurance coverage is not the only basis of data capture (see ENROLLMENT_BASIS) nor do all records necessarily indicate completeness of data capture (see the capture warning variables, which all begin with 'INCOMPLETE'). Each record represents a period of time during which the information on the included variables was true.  As many records as are necessary should be added to represent changes over time. There may be many contiguous records for a single period of enrollment, in order to account for these changes. However, periods may NOT overlap one another; there should be only one record covering any given day + medical record number. The following figure illustrates this concept:

Periods that are ongoing at the time the file is created should bear the last day of known, actual enrollment at the time of the update. E.g. is source data is realtime, enr\_end would be set to &sysdate but is source data is updated weekly, enr\_end would be the last day of the week prior to the update.

### The Data Capture Variables

A '\[N\]o'value on the INCOMPLETE\_* variables is *not* an assertion that data capture is actually complete--it only signifies that there is no known reason for it to be *in*complete.  If an implementer has no reason to suspect that capture is especially suspect, they should use the \[N\]o value.  This is why there is no 'unknown' valid value defined—if you don't know of a specific, unusual reason that capture should be incomplete (like one of the examples listed below) you use \[N\]o. Examples of known deficits include:

  * Your organization offers a health plan in conjunction with a network of partner providers, creating a class of people for whom your organization is an insurer but not a health care provider.  People in these plans would likely have complete capture of encounters (via claims) but would not appear in EMR or Lab data.
  * Your research organization gets its Tumor data from a regional registrar, whose catchment area does not cover all of your enrollees/patients.  You can tell based on their county of residence whether tumors diagnosed in those people/periods should appear in your VDW Tumor data.

(Both of these examples are true at KP Washington.)

Users are advised to treat N and X values in the INCOMPLETE\_* variables as essentially identical in information content.  For applications that require, for example, complete Tumor data over time, we recommend using a condition like:  `WHERE incomplete_tumor ne "Y"`. When in doubt please check with your sites.

### Sites May Have Additional Variables

Many sites have added site-specific variables that are not a part of the specifications. At these sites, users may well find multiple records for contiguous time periods, over which none of the official specification variables change. Users will likely be interested in the `%CollapsePeriods` or enrollment-related macros for collapsing records in to continuous periods.
