# Objectives

1. Illustrate what our process(es) would be if we were to switch to markdown on github.com for our specifications
2. review markdown format
3. explain github
4. discuss pros and cons

# Introduction

1. Why our specs are important
   * Because our data warehouse is Virtual, no single person can see/touch the whole thing at any given time.
   * There's not really anything enforcing the structure/content of our implementations
   * Even if you can find out everything's completely synced and legit today, that could change by tomorrow.
      * Bugs get fixed.
      * Data gets added
      * Source systems get changed out from under implementers
      * Bugs get introduced
   * The specs are our North Star in all this.

2. History of HCSRN Spec formats
   1. word documents in e-mail
   2. word documents on a web portal (uncoordinated)
   3. harmonized word documents on a web portal (or was it a wiki? I don't actually remember)
   4. excel spreadsheet

2. Why where we keep them is important
   * canonicality (Tina Belcher equestranauts example)
   * synchronizing the shared delusion of the VDW
   * accessibility

3. Why the web is an excellent choice for displaying our specs
   * anybody can get at it
   * easy to bookmark
   * no need to wonder if your colleague is seeing the same thing as you--you're reading the same files.

4. But--HTML is kind of a pain to write & maintain
  ::screenshot of inspect view of say, https://datawranglr.com/d3_demo/enrollments.html::
  * so flexible, which is awesome and horrible
  * you can use any sort of editor (notepad!) but have to know the tags, make sure they're balanced, etc.
  * certainly not beyond the abilities of anybody on this call, but--it's a pain
  * Enter _MARKDOWN_

5. Markdown

Markdown is just a set of conventions for formatting a plain text document that makes it trivially simple to output as actual HTML.

* without having to worry about what the tags are called, or balancing them
* without having to use fancy or pricey software
* or pay any licensing fees
* or worry that your reader won't have the same version of the software as you
* which is understood the world over.

You can create markdown on any device running any operating system.


3. Audiences
   1. implementers
   3. study programmer-users
   2. investigator-users
   4. funders?
   5. other external ppl?
